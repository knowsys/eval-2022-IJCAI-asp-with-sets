 * Depending on the state of the reasoning (materialisation) and its
 * {@link KnowledgeBase}, the answers can have a different {@link Correctness}
 * <ul>
 * <li>If {@link Correctness#SOUND_AND_COMPLETE}, materialisation over current
 * knowledge base has completed, and the query answers are guaranteed to be
 * correct.</li>
 * <li>If {@link Correctness#SOUND_BUT_INCOMPLETE}, the results are guaranteed

 * <ul>
 * <li>when materialisation has not completed ({@link Reasoner#reason()} returns
 * {@code false}),</li>
 * <li>or when the knowledge base was modified after reasoning, and the
 * materialisation does not reflect the current knowledge base.
 * Re-materialisation ({@link Reasoner#reason()}) is required in order to obtain
 * complete query answers with respect to the current knowledge base.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * <li>If {@link Correctness#INCORRECT}, the results may be incomplete, and some
 * results may be unsound. This can happen when the knowledge base was modified
 * and the reasoner materialisation is no longer consistent with the current
 * knowledge base. Re-materialisation ({@link Reasoner#reason()}) is required,
